# Calculator Application (Tkinter)

## About
The **Calculator Application** is a simple yet powerful desktop GUI app built using **Python’s Tkinter library**.  
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in a user-friendly interface.

This project demonstrates core GUI programming concepts and is ideal for Python beginners who want to practice **event-driven programming**, **Tkinter widgets**, and **function-based logic**.

---

## Features
- Perform basic mathematical operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
-  Clear input using the **C** button
- Real-time calculation display
- Built with Tkinter — lightweight and easy to run
- Beginner-friendly and customizable

---

## How It Works
1. The app opens a GUI window with buttons for digits and operators.
2. Each button press appends the value to an internal expression string.
3. When `=` is pressed, the expression is evaluated using Python’s `eval()` function.
4. The result is displayed instantly in the entry box.
5. `C` clears the current input.

## Example Output
```
+--------------------------+
|        12 + 8            |
|--------------------------|
|  [7] [8] [9] [+]         |
|  [4] [5] [6] [-]         |
|  [1] [2] [3] [*]         |
|  [0] [C] [=] [/]         |
+--------------------------+
Result → 20

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter GUI Library**
- **eval()** function for expression evaluation

---

## Future Improvements
- Add a **scientific mode** (square root, power, etc.)
- Add **keyboard input support**
- Improve UI with modern themes (e.g., `ttkbootstrap`)
- Add **error handling** for invalid expressions
