# 🧮 Calculator Application (Tkinter)

## 📝 About
The **Calculator Application** is a simple yet powerful desktop GUI app built using **Python’s Tkinter library**.  
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in a user-friendly interface.

This project demonstrates core GUI programming concepts and is ideal for Python beginners who want to practice **event-driven programming**, **Tkinter widgets**, and **function-based logic**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🧠 Perform basic mathematical operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- 🧹 Clear input using the **C** button
- ⚡ Real-time calculation display
- 💻 Built with Tkinter — lightweight and easy to run
- 👨‍💻 Beginner-friendly and customizable

---

## 🧩 How It Works
1. The app opens a GUI window with buttons for digits and operators.
2. Each button press appends the value to an internal expression string.
3. When `=` is pressed, the expression is evaluated using Python’s `eval()` function.
4. The result is displayed instantly in the entry box.
5. `C` clears the current input.
