# Central Library App

A Python-based **Central Library Management System** that allows users to list, borrow, return, and search for books using a simple text-based interface ‚Äî enhanced with **voice interaction** using `pyttsx3`.

---

## Features

**List Books** ‚Äì View all available books in the library  
**Borrow Books** ‚Äì Borrow a book and automatically update the record  
**Return Books** ‚Äì Return a book (handles duplicates automatically)  
**Search Books** ‚Äì Search whether a specific book is available  
**Voice Support** ‚Äì Each action is read aloud using the `pyttsx3` library for a better user experience  
**File Management** ‚Äì Uses a `.txt` file to maintain library data persistently  

---

## How It Works

The app stores book records inside a file named `Central_Library_File.txt`.  
Each time you borrow or return a book, the system updates this file automatically ‚Äî no database needed!
